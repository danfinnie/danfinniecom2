# Why I'm joining Alphabet Workers Union

Daniel Finnie - Jan 4 2020

## The Past

I never thought I would be joining a union, much less one at Google.  My visions of unions were images of striking steelworkers and [rubber rooms for impossible-to-fire teachers](https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/nyc-pays-rubber-room-teacher-six-figures-20-years-after-sex-abuse-claims/).

I have been a Google fanboy since high school, when I traveled to San Francisco for the first time to attend Google IO in 2010.  My friend and I shared a hotel room in the Tenderloin, and Google employees spent their time teaching us Android and other technologies.  That summer, I received support and prize money from Google for contributing to Python in the [Google Highly Open Participation Contest](https://developers.google.com/open-source/ghop/).

I would have been against unionizing when I started at Google in 2015.  Installing a RAM upgrade for my desktop reminded me of building my own computer in middle school -- would a union make it so that I need to wait for a union-authorized technician to install RAM?  On my first work trip to Mountain View, I made sure to get a good seat at TGIF to watch execs answer questions honestly, even when it was Sergey Brin responding to an employee complaint about internet reimbursement -- would a union stifle internal transparency and access to execs?  I saw my pay increase as I earned good performance ratings and promotions -- would a union protect low performers at my expense?

I certainly never felt mistreated.  I remember cringing when coworkers complained about the healthy, delicious free food, and shaking my head when they mused that it would be nice if the food were delivered to their desks.  I scoffed at coworkers who complained that my 11am meeting was “too early for their schedule.”

On a more serious note, I remember being skeptical when I submitted a sexual harassment complaint to HR, but pleasantly surprised when that person was fired a few weeks later, and surprised again when I received a full explanation from HR.  Leaders in HR were willing to talk to me about why the reasons for his firing were not officially made public.  Google far exceeded my expectations in this sexual harassment complaint.  (I respect that this has not been everyone’s experience and I have seen mishandled incidents as well.)  My grievances were promptly addressed, so why would I need a union?  Would a union have made this perpetrator impossible to fire?

When I had ACL reconstruction surgery, I was able to take all the time I needed for the recovery (although I ended up getting bored and working!).  I worked from home for over a month until I could ride the subway, shifted my hours to be able to get a seat on the subway, and attended physical therapy during the workday.  Doctors kept offering me notes to give to my manager, which they never asked for.  I’m grateful for all of that.

I remember my team in News hosting journalists and students all the time so that we could gain a connection to the industry.  I remember some journalism students asking me what would surprise them the most to hear about Google.  My response was that the individual contributors on my team are thinking daily about users and keeping journalism alive, not money.  How rare is that?  I still feel this way and I’m proud of our leadership for fostering this culture.  

Recently, I remember being proud of Google for having employees work from home early in the pandemic and continuing to pay cafeteria workers.  I sent Sundar a thank you note and he replied.  Google is still a place where employees call the CEO by their first name and they reply to random emails from individual contributors.

## The Now

[Paul Duke](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/fired-google-employees-nlrb-investigation-cbp) was on my team when he and several others were fired. He was an internal whistleblower that Google saw as a threat.  My first thought, despite us having a personal connection, was that being fired was the natural result of his actions.  Some will think the same of [Google firing AI ethicist Timnit Gebru](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist) -- Google is positioning itself as an AI-first company, so publishing papers that point out AI’s flaws does not seem in Google’s best interest.

In the year since Paul was fired, my views shifted.  I now see what Paul Duke, Timnit Gebru, Claire Stapleton, Meredith Whittaker, and others were doing as the most pro-Google thing they knew how to do.  If they disliked Google, they would have quit.  What they saw is Google - which they felt pride and ownership in - losing its way, and they were trying to change that.  They saw an emperor with no clothes and tried to tell the emperor.

From both a moral and a business perspective, I think they were right.  Google is coming from a position of strength and competing based on data, user trust, and innovation.  In this space, good morals align with good business sense:
* Google’s greatest asset is its employees, and these repeated scandals are leading some to quit, demoralizing others, and leaving behind the complacent ones.  Are the remaining employees the ones who are thinking of revolutionary, world-changing ideas?
* Google should address the environmental and bias issues with AI, not try to sweep them under the rug.  Not doing so is as short-sighted as ExxonMobile pretending that climate change doesn’t exist.  True leadership would embrace these challenges, developing solutions rather than hiding problems.
* AI research is increasingly done at tech companies instead of universities.  If Google wants top researchers and to collaborate with universities, it should offer them true academic freedom.
* Public trust in Google is shaken by these reports.  For instance, I would not ride in a Tesla or Uber self-driving car because I know that they have grueling cultures that promote making and hiding mistakes.  I have considered travelling to Phoenix to ride in a Waymo self-driving car because I believe that they have a safety-first culture.  How many users have switched to Apple products or other search engines because they don’t trust Google?  How many people will start unchecking tracking consent options?

I don’t feel mistreated as a worker by Google, but I think that the company’s recent decisions have hurt both its moral compass and business position.

Larry and Sergey [famously held on to control of Google during its IPO](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/business/letter-from-the-founders.html) because Google is “not a conventional company” and to “optimize our long term earnings.”  I agree with this goal, but these recent short-sighted decisions make it clear that the founders’ voting rights alone are not enough to make this a reality.  We need to take additional steps for the sake of Google.

I see Google’s culture of transparency and embracing challenges slipping, and I am hoping that a union will help restore this culture and make Google a strong company well into the future.  The  Communication Workers of America have filed complaints about [Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html) and [Amazon](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/technology/amazon-unions-ftc.html) recently.  I am confident that in both of these cases, concerns were raised and ignored internally before the issue made it to unions and government regulators.  I hope having a union will make it so that Google takes concerns seriously and addresses them head on internally before they become global incidents.

I don’t know if this is the right way forward.  I have my concerns about unions.  Ultimately though, right now I see some people with an idea to reverse a Google in decline, so I vote to try it.
